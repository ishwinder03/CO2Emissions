# CO2Emissions

Conducted a sensitivity of analysis of how a sudden increase in CO2 emissions affects the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species, partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and the atmospheric temperature at high and low latitudes.

The graphs have differnt lines indicating the different regions of high latitude, low latitude, deep ocean and surface ocean.
